# c4-lib

Template that is C4, MPLv2 and has Travis and Clojars Continuous Deployment

## Usage

Use the following leiningen command to create a new library called library-name

    lein new c4-lib library-name

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment requires secure environment variables so deployment is initially disabled in the .travis.yml file.  To enable Continuous Deployment add the required secure variables ([Clojars](https://clojars.org/) username and password, [GitHub secure token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) and the releasers email address) securely and uncomment the deploy section.

## Hacking on this Template
